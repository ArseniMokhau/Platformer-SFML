A platformer game developed in C++ with SFML, leveraging its object-oriented
features. The project includes sprite rendering, collision detection, player
movement mechanics, entity interactions, and a graphical user interface.

In this game, the character's movement is influenced by realistic physics model, which includes drag effects and non-linear acceleration for more dynamic gameplay.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some objects can influence character's movement by, for example, slowing them down.

<br />
The enemies in this game are subject to gravity, similar to the player character.<br />
Their movement and actions are synchronized with a game clock that controls the timing for all game events.

<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also multiple types of objects, like, for example, saws or spikes.<br />
Getting hit by them returns the player character to the beginning.

<br />
To finish the game, the player has to collide with the lever and push it to the end.<br />
The game can then be closed by pressing "Escape".
